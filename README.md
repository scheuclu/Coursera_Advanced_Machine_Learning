# Advanced Machine Learning

This repository is dedicated to storing my work on the Cousera Advanced Deep Learning 5-course specialization.  


The parent folder contains some file and scripts like
 - [conda_requirements.txt](conda_requirements.txt): An Anaconda environement specification. The only additional package you need to install is tensorflow or tensorflow-gpu if you wish.
 - [watch_gpu_usage.sh](watch_gpu_usage.sh): A console-based GPU sureveillance tool.

The notebooks themselves lie in [intro-to-dl](intro-to-dl).
